# Colour Splash

## Colour Combination Tester
An easy-to-use website for trying out combinations of colours. The user can then replicate their colour selection in their own website or project. The website is made up of two pages: a homepage with site introduction, call to action, user reviews and contact form; a tester page with interactive color picker buttons and help, share and refresh control options. 

The primary goal of the website is to offer a simple tool which users, from designers to amateurs, will return to every time they need to experiment with colours. They might even recommend the site to their friends or colleagues. A website with heavy traffic offers an optimal space for paid advertisements, should the owner wish to monetize it.

## UX
