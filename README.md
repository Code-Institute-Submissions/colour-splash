# Colour Splash

## Colour Combination Tester
An easy-to-use website for trying out combinations of colours. The user can then replicate their colour selection in their own website or project. The website is made up of two pages: a homepage with site introduction, call to action, user reviews and contact form; a tester page with interactive color picker buttons and help, share and refresh control options. 

The primary goal of the website is to offer a simple tool which users, from designers to amateurs, will return to every time they need to experiment with colours. They might even recommend the site to their friends or colleagues. A website with heavy traffic offers an optimal space for paid advertisements, should the owner wish to monetize it.

## UX
### User-Website Interaction

**Users of this website are looking for:**

- A space to test out different combinations of colours;
- Inspiration/suggestions for attractive colour combinations;
- Both a simple and efficient way of selecting colour combinations.

**This website facilitates this for the user by providing:**

- Simple-to-use color picker buttons;
- Both background and textual samples that can have their colour changed;
- Straightforward steps for use, including visual prompts, under the 'help' control;
- A 'share' option so users can save their colour selection locally;
- Easy navigation - text is kept to a minimum, clear call to action, two-page website, clean layout.
